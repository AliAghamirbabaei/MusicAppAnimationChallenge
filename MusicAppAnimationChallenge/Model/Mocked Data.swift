[Pre-Chorus]
My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?

[Chorus]
I-I-I, got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones (In my bones)
I-I-I, got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause there's magic in my bones

[Bridge]
Look in the mirror of my mind
Turnin' the pages of my life
Walkin' the path so many paced a million times
Drown out the voices in the air
Leavin' the ones that never cared
Pickin' the pieces up and buildin’ to the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
[Chorus]
I-I-I, got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones (Magic in my bones)
I-I-I, got this feeling in my soul (Soul)
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

[Outro]
There goes my mind, (I-I-I) don't mind
There goes my mind (There it goes, there it goes)
There goes my mind, (I-I-I) don't mind
There goes my mind (There it goes)
'Cause there's magic in my bones

[Intro: Dan Reynolds]
Look out for yourself

[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (Ha)

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & JID]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look; yeah)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look, okay

[Verse 3: JID]
I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat


[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy

[Outro: Dan Reynolds]
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint
(Look out for yourself)

[Intro]
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah

[Verse 1]
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Yeah, ah

[Refrain]
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Verse 2]
I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in
Whoa

[Refrain]
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa

[Bridge]
All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Verse 1]
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail
I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

[Verse 3]
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…


[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

[Verse 4]
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up

[Verse 1]
Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

[Refrain]
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck

[Verse 2]
They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

[Refrain]
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along

[Bridge]
These days when I'm on the brink of the edge
I remember the words that you said
"Remember the life you led"
You'd say, "Oh, suck it all up, don't get stuck in the mud
Thinking of things that you should have done"
I'll see you again, my loved one
I'll see you again, my loved one
Yeah, I'm a wreck
I'll see you again, my loved one

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a wreck without you here
(I'm a wreck without you here, loved one)
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
(I'm a wreck since you've been gone)
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along (I'm a wreck)
Yeah, I'm a wreck

[Outro]
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away (But I can't)
One more rainy day without you (One more rainy day)
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day (But I can't)
One more rainy day

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

(I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)

[Verse 1]
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well, I'm just a slave unto the night

[Pre-Chorus]
(I bet, I bet my life)
Now remember when I told you (I)
That's the last you'll see of me? (I)
Remember when I broke you down to tears? (I)
(Woo-oooo-ooh, I bet, I bet my life)
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me (I)
I gave you hell through all the years (I)

[Chorus]
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you

[Verse 2]
I've been around the world
And never in my wildest dreams
Would I come runnin' home to you
(I bet, I bet my life)
I've told a million lies (I)
But now I tell a single truth (I)
There's you in everything I do (I)

Remember when I broke you down to tears?

[Bridge]
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I play
Please forgive me for all I've done

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
